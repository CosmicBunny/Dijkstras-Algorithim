# Dijkstras-Algorithim
Program to demonstrate Dijkstras Algorithim

The program prompts the user to input the number of nobes for the algorithim and the max distance range between the nodes.
The distances are then assigned randomly between the nodes and Dijkstras algorithim show the shortest path from node 1 to every other node.
